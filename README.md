# Development-of-Tele-Operated-Interbotix-WX-Series-Arm
Developed Python algorithms with ROS2 for tele-operation and manipulation of Interbotix X-Series Robotic Arm

# Introduction
- Head Tracking for Tele-operation of Interbotix WX200 Robotic Arm
- The end effector of the robotic arm acts as the vision of the robotic head 
- Intel RealSense depth camera (D415) is mounted on the end effector of the robotic arm, as it acts as the vision of the robotic head
- Robotic arm acts as the the neck for the robotic head (pitch, yaw, roll, head lean forwards/backwards)

# Controlling the Interbotix WX200 Robotic Arm with GY-85 9D0F IMU Sensor 
- Obtaining pitch, roll and yaw data from the IMU sensor, to control the movements of the end effector of the robotic arm
